## General Information
The aim of this project is to allow users to create home made cocktails and enjoy great meals at home. DineInside offers a search function so users can look up cocktails involving their favorite drinks and even the option for a meal to accompany your drink. The site also offers visual examples of both the cocktails and the drinks so users can have an idea of what each item looks like.
